/*
 * TransPA Public API
 *
 * # This API exposes functionality in Visma TransPA. ## Authentication The API can be tested without authentication against the mock server in the **Servers** pulldown list. To test against the actual backend you have to register a user on the *Visma Developer Portal* and request access to the API along with the required scopes. The scopes required are documented under each endpoint. For more information about *Visma Developer Portal* see <https://developer.visma.com>. <br/> <br/>  Authentication uses OAuth tokens from *Visma Connect*. Authorization is done on tenant level, so one OAuth token is needed per tenant.<br/> <br/> The scope `transpaapi:api` grants basic access to the API and is required for all routes. Additional scopes might be required and are described inside each route description. <br/> ## Details All monetary amounts are in the organizations local currency unless otherwise specified. <br/> <br/> ```[Not Ready]``` This is an endpoint where development has not completed and is therefore subject to change.
